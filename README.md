# DNA Promoter Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project builds a binary classification model to identify promoter
regions in DNA sequences.

## Dataset

-   Source: UCI Molecular Biology Dataset
-   106 DNA sequences
-   Sequence length: 57 nucleotides

## Methodology

-   Sequence structuring
-   One-hot encoding
-   Train-test split (75/25)
-   10-fold cross-validation

## Models

KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Neural Network, SVM
(Linear/RBF/Sigmoid)

## Results

Kernel-based and ensemble models performed best.

## Applications

Genome annotation, disease research, drug discovery.
